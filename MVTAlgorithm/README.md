#### MULTIPROGRAMMING WITH A VARIABLE NUMBER OF TASKS
___
MVT (Multiprogramming with a Variable number of Tasks) is the
memory management technique in which each job gets just the amount of memory it needs. That is, the
partitioning of memory is dynamic and changes as jobs enter and leave the system.

#### HOW IT WORKS
This program accept the following as inputs

- Total Memory Available
- Memory Require for every Process

After accepting the input it then compute the following
-  Memory Allocation

    Which is `if Memory Require for a particular < Total Memory Available there will allocation else there will be no allocation`
- External Fragmentation



After the computation, the program then display the following
- Total Memory Available
- Total Memory Allocated
- Total External Fragmentation

##### RUN CODE
To run the this program. You should
copy the entire contents of any of the algorithm into a project in the IDE or Text Editor, and then run the Main.java in the folder.
