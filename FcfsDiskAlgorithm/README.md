#### FIRST-COME-FIRST-SERVE DISK SCHEDULING ALGORITHM
___
FCFS is the simplest disk scheduling algorithm. As the name suggests, this algorithm entertains requests in the order they arrive in the disk queue.

#### HOW IT WORKS
This program accept the following as inputs

- Number of Tracks
- Tracks to be traversed

After accepting the input it then compute the following
-  Difference between Tracks

    Which is `Track to traversed next - Previous track traversed`
-  Average Header Movement

    Which is `total of Difference in track / Number of tracks`




After the computation, the program then display the following
- Tracks traversed
- Difference between tracks
- Average header movements
