####  BEST FIT MEMOERY MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUE
___
In this memory management technique, the operating system first searches the whole of the memory according to the size of the given job and allocates it to the closest-fitting free partition in the memory, making it able to use memory efficiently.


#### HOW IT WORKS
This program accept the following as inputs

- Number of Blocks
- Number of Files
- Size of every Block
- Size of every Files

After accepting the input it then compute the following
-  Fragmentation

    Which is `Block size - file`
- Allocation
    Which is `assigning the file to the best fit block size`


After the computation, the program then display the following
- Block numbers
- Block sizes
- Files sizes
-File numbers
- Fragmentation for every block

##### RUN CODE
To run the this program. You should
copy the entire contents of any of the algorithm into a project in the IDE or Text Editor, and then run the Main.java in the folder.
